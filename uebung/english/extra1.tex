\begin{aufgabe}[High/Low]
Implement the game High/Low: A player (in this case the computer) thinks of a number between 1 and 100, the other player (in this case the user) needs to guess the number. After each try, the user is informed if his guess was too high, too low, or correct.

Proceed by the following steps:
\begin{teilaufgabe}
The program lets the user play one round and displays the number of guesses at the end of the round.
\hinweis You can create a random number between 1 and 100 by using \lstinline{random.randint(1, 100)}.
\end{teilaufgabe}
\begin{teilaufgabe}
The program asks after each round if the user wants to play again.
\end{teilaufgabe}
\begin{teilaufgabe}
The program saves a high score list in a file.
\end{teilaufgabe}

\end{aufgabe}
